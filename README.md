# Project Kickstart

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.0-blue.svg)]()

## Overview

Project Kickstart is a lightweight and optimized template to start projects of any kind, with standard configurations for GitHub and Visual Studio Code. Its goal is to reduce initial setup time and improve consistency in development environments, allowing developers to focus on what matters from the beginning.

## Key Features

- **Standard configurations**: Includes configurations for GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
- **Ease of use**: Ready to use without additional configurations.
- **Time optimization**: Allows developers to focus on development rather than initial configurations.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com) account

## Quick Start

1. Click **Use this template** on the [project page](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura/project-kickstart) or clone the repository:

   ```bash
   # Clone the template with your project name
   git clone https://github.com/sergio-ridaura/project-kickstart.git my-project

   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd my-project

   # Open in Visual Studio Code
   code .

   # Initialize new Git repository
   git init
   ```

2. **Review the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)** of the template to familiarize yourself with the template and learn the recommended workflow. If you already have experience, you can skip this step.

3. **Organize the template** to separate the template documentation from your project:

   ```bash
   # Create folder to archive the template
   mkdir -p ../project-kickstart

   # Move the template documentation
   mv docs ../project-kickstart/
   mv README.md ../project-kickstart/
   ```

4. **Customize the documentation** using the template documents as reference. Create your own Readme, basic documentation and project structure based on the examples in `project-kickstart`. Once you have your documentation ready, delete the template folder.

5. **Start development** of your application following the guidelines and best practices defined in the project documentation.

üöÄ That's it! You now have an environment ready to develop in an agile, efficient and well-structured way.
