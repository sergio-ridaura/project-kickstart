# Proposal: Project Kickstart

This document proposes a solution to address a need. Its objective is to communicate the benefits and scope of the initial project to facilitate decisions and collaboration.

## Description

A lightweight and optimized template to start projects of any kind. It includes essential configurations for GitHub and Visual Studio Code, allowing developers to focus on development from the very beginning.

## Problem

Setting up a development environment from scratch can be tedious and consume valuable time that could be dedicated to project development.

### Key Issues

- **Time lost**: Setting up tools and workflows from scratch consumes time.
- **Common errors**: Lack of standard configurations can lead to avoidable errors.
- **Lack of consistency**: Teams may have different configurations, making collaboration difficult.

## Solution

Provide a preconfigured template that includes the essential tools and configurations to start developing immediately.

### Key Solutions

- **Standard configurations**: Includes configurations for GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
- **Ease of use**: Ready to use without additional configurations.
- **Time optimization**: Allows developers to focus on development rather than initial configurations.

### What it does NOT include

- Specific configurations for programming languages.
- Custom documentation for specific projects.

## Conclusion

Project Kickstart is an ideal solution for developers and teams looking to start projects quickly with standard and optimized configurations. It reduces initial setup time and improves consistency in development environments.
