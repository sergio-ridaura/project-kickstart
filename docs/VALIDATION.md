# Project Validation

This document describes the project validation process and results, ensuring that it meets the objectives and success criteria defined in the [Proposal](PROPOSAL.md).

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to formalize the validation process, establishing a clear framework to verify that the project meets the established functional and quality requirements. Validation is performed to ensure that the final product is robust, efficient and satisfies user needs.

## Validation Criteria

Validation criteria are based on the objectives defined in the [Proposal](PROPOSAL.md) and success criteria of the [Action Plan](ACTION_PLAN.md).

- **Setup Time Reduction**:

  - **Criterion**: Users can start a project and have it ready in their local environment in less than 5 minutes.
  - **Method**: Time the process by following the steps in the "Quick Start" section of the `README.md` file.

- **Configuration Consistency**:

  - **Criterion**: VS Code configurations and repository files are compatible and functional on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - **Method**: Test the template in different environments to ensure there are no conflicts or configuration errors.

- **Documentation Integrity and Clarity**:

  - **Criterion**: Documentation is complete, coherent and easy to understand for a new user.
  - **Method**: Check that all documents linked in `README.md` and `ACTION_PLAN.md` are completed and aligned with the project's purpose.

- **Action Plan Compliance**:
  - **Criterion**: 100% of the tasks defined in the Action Plan are completed.
  - **Method**: Verify the status of all tasks listed in the implementation plan.

## Validation Results

This section records the results of the validation tests.
